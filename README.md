2. How to play the game

Move the player safely to the water, and remember to avoid the nasty bugs.
Use the up/down/left/right arrow keys to move the player.
Be careful, if you run out of lives, it's game over~

Collect bonus gems to increase your score!
Blue gem = 50 points, green gem = 100 points, orange gem = 150 points
When you win, each remaining life counts for 100 points.

GL HF!
